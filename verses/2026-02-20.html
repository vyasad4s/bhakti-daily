  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="sanskrit">या निशा सर्वभूतानां</p>
  <p class="sanskrit">तस्यां जागर्ति संयमी ।</p>
  <p class="sanskrit">यस्यां जाग्रति भूतानि</p>
  <p class="sanskrit">सा निशा पश्यतो मुनेः ॥</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="transliteration">yā niśā sarva-bhūtānāṁ</p>
  <p class="transliteration">tasyāṁ jāgarti saṁyamī</p>
  <p class="transliteration">yasyāṁ jāgrati bhūtāni</p>
  <p class="transliteration">sā niśā paśyato muneḥ</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="translation">What is night for all beings is the time of awakening for the self-controlled; and the time of awakening for all beings is night for the introspective sage.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="commentary">Two realities exist simultaneously. For those absorbed in material pursuits, spiritual discrimination is darkness — they literally cannot see it. The self-controlled yogi lives in that "night" fully awake, perceiving what the masses miss entirely. Complete polarity.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="commentary">The "wakefulness" of material culture — its achievements, ambitions, sensory pleasures — is actually sleep in disguise. The sage sees what others are too busy to look at. This is viveka operating at full capacity: one who has completely inverted the default setting of consciousness.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="commentary">The progression continues: BG 2.66 established prerequisites, 2.67 showed sense capture, 2.68 demonstrated restraint → established intelligence. Now 2.69: the ultimate result — saṁyamī, self-control, creates complete perceptual inversion. The yogi is awake when others sleep.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="commentary">🔥 YS II.54 — svārṣānubhūtiviṣayāsaṁprayoge cittasya svarūpānukāra ivendriyāṇāṁ pratyāhāraḥ — "The withdrawal of the senses from their objects that follows the mastery of the mind is pratyāhāra."</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="commentary">BG 2.69 describes the result of pratyāhāra practiced to perfection. When senses withdraw, the yogi no longer perceives sense objects as "real" — they become like dreams to the waking mind. Patañjali defines pratyāhāra as the mind's return to its own form; BG 2.69 shows this mastery complete.</p>
