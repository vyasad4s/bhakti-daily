  <p class="transliteration">tāni sarvāṇi saṁyamya<br>yukta āsīta mat-paraḥ<br>vaśe hi yasyendriyāṇi<br>tasya prajñā pratiṣṭhitā</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p class="translation">"Having restrained them all, one should sit concentrated; intent on Me. His wisdom is truly established who has his senses under control."</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p class="commentary">The struggle of yesterday becomes the rootedness of today. Saṁyamya — not suppression but unified direction, all senses gathered and consecrated. Yukta — the mind yoked to Īśvara, neither scattered nor grasping. This is the Mūla energy: the root found. Where yesterday the senses dragged by force, today they rest (āsīta) — seated, settled, obedient (vaśe). Wisdom (prajñā) becomes pratiṣṭhitā — not fleeting insight but founded understanding, the unshakeable discrimination that knows puruṣa distinct from prakṛti.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p class="commentary">Yoga Sūtra 1.2 — Yogaś citta-vṛtti-nirodhaḥ — "Yoga is the cessation of mental modifications." BG 2.61 gives the method: mat-paraḥ (intent on Me) is the viveka that ultimately stills citta-vṛtti. The citta becomes nirodha not by effort alone but by buddhi's exclusive devotion to the Supreme.</p>
