  <p class="sanskrit">ये जनाः पर्युपासते</p>

  <p class="transliteration">ananyāś cintayanto māṁ ye janāḥ paryupāsate teṣāṁ nityābhiyuktānāṁ yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p class="translation">"But those who worship Me with exclusive devotion, meditating on My transcendental form— to them I carry what they lack and preserve what they have."</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p class="commentary">This is the profound assurance of the Divine Friend. The devotee does not need to anxiously secure their material or spiritual welfare; consciousness absorbed in Kṛṣṇa finds that preservation (kṣema) and attainment (yoga) are effortlessly managed. It is not that the Lord merely permits—He personally carries (vahāmi) the devotee's needs. This requires nothing less than single-pointed attention— the mind without fragmentation, the heart offered without reservation.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p class="commentary">Yoga Sūtra 1.23 — Īśvara praṇidhānād vā — "Or [samādhi may be attained] by surrender to Īśvara." Patañjali teaches surrender as the direct means; this sūtra pairs perfectly with the 9th chapter's revelation that bhakti is not merely a method but the culmination of all paths.</p>
