  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p class="translation">"The senses are so strong and impetuous, O Arjuna, that they forcibly carry away the mind even of a man of discrimination who is endeavoring to control them."</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p class="commentary">The senses are wild horses—powerful, impetuous, demanding. Even the discerning mind can be dragged away against its will. This is not a failure of character but recognition of prakṛti's strength. The one attempting to control the senses is understood—discipline is required precisely because the forces are formidable. This verse honors the struggle: it acknowledges that simply wanting self-mastery is not enough. The senses have momentum, inertia, power. But they can be reined.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p class="commentary">Yoga Sūtra 2.54 — Pratyāhāraḥ saṁprajñāta-samādhiḥ — "Pratyāhāra is the withdrawal of the senses from their objects, following the nature of the mind." Patañjali's pratyāhāra is the practical response: just as the tortoise withdraws its limbs, the yogi withdraws senses from objects. It is not suppression—it is skillful disengagement so the mind can turn inward toward puruṣa.</p>
